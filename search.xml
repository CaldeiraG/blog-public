        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone! This is my first blog post in here since I’ve installed <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. It’s a pretty cool framework but more into that later.</p><p>I’m CaldeiraG, I’m 21 years old and lived all my life in Portugal. </p><p>I do full-stack web development for 2 years now but currently expanding my portfolio of languages such as Go and Node.js. I also have some experience with Python, C# and C++.</p><p>I can consider myself as a enthusiast among the tech community, making websites for fun, fiddle around with server hardware and more recently a Raspberry Pi and some VPS’es.</p><p>I want this blog to serve as a journal of what I’m currently working on/interested in, maybe reviews of products I buy and more. I’m excited to start this blog with some cool content.</p><p>If you’re interested to see what I’ve built over the years, you can check out my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CaldeiraG">here</a> or on the sidebar.</p><p>That’s it! Have a good day all :)</p>]]></content>
